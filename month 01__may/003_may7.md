well, whoops. i started this in the morning but i suppose i never got to it!

i had a pleasant call in the morning with a classmate. i love when people share the projects they are working on. the love that i hold close to me really shows, in the sense that i feel just as invested as they do when they speak of passions. "they" is subjective.

i had a long chat (lol) and did some planning
i got ready for the 'day'
and then met up for a really nice and very calming chat around USC!

i ran into some friends for the little bit on campus,
and then got super hyped for life hahah.

closing out the day with some work,
maybe some suits,
definitely pistachio ice cream.

love love from mei
