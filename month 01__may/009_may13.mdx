today i will:
- reorganize my office
- move desk into cubby
- move vanity
- move bookshelf
- pin up papers on the wall
- begin readings that are on my davinci list
- figure out what structure i am going to make my crypto site thingy in
- text back all of my people. i need to answer my texts.

thinking about
- evangelizing value
- how to acclimate all college students and all of the entire population to decentralization and crypto governance
- how to onboard more people to tari university
- how can gift cards be made
- comparing effective teaching to simply being a medium of info
- accounting theories.. the ratio of loss when hiring? value? other things corporate-specific xd

YAYYYY the day has begun! it's 2p now, i wrote the rest of this note at an ungodly hour. i think. don't remember.

anyways,
i'm hopping into an internal call rn 
going to summarize notes
and onboard a bunch of influencers
onto a program made for PMsðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

goes to show how much the things i learn influence my work and conversation points lol
but also!
apparently i'm going to make a "factory" 
don't really want to say. 
but i am going to create a factory
and i am going to devour
and encapsulate
like a huge blanket that takes over the world
exciting!!!

going to continue my manifesto
seeee yaaa
