day one
it's may fifth! yay.

today i woke up as late as i possibly could,
started cleaning,
got in a very heated conversation,
cleaned some more.
today is the first day that i'm free from university duties, so i'm taking some time to tidy. i have so many papers EVERYWHERE, at some point i think i give up on being analog.

next, i've got to clean
<ol>
  <li>the rest of my file folders</li>
  <li>my vanity and its horrendous drawer</li>
  <li>the clothing drawers</li>
  <li>my closet, and take out all of the unnecessary jackets</li>
  <li>fold and tuck away my plain shirts</li>
  <li>the bins of high school clothing downstairs</li>
  <li>once that's all done, i really want to clean out my computer files!!! she's so slow for NO reason. bruh.</li>
</ol>

so yes! it's a day of cleaning, trying to feel clean, and trying to calm my mind. i'm going way fast!

also, although i love paper, i think i will make a new cycle

- learn to annotate from a screen
- wear the damn blue light glasses bro
- take notes for EVERYTHING in ONE notebook. none of this 'notebook per subject' bullshit
- consolidate the date-dependent books.
- abide by state-dependent books and papers.
- enjoy it
