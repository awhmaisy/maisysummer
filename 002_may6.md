yayy wonderful day so far! slept "in" (meaning i set an alarm for 11am and tried my best to feel peaceful as i fell asleep knowing i could breathe calmly and have an alarm go off)
had a nice market research call

working on a deck w my partner in crime
need to film a tiktok... looool
and then helping to run a creator workshop.

i cleaned files successfully!

and next is drawers.

slight bit of chaos because thinking of going to lunch with friends.. but i have to get myself out of the house and over to century city, somehow.

ubering that far is not going to be MF fun.
and i'm afraid of rush hour.

but! either way! my drawers need attention soon.
