yahooo new day!! 

whiteboarding today was very fun but it forced me to realize that i'm really disinterested in generating a system of learning. 
i really wanted to structure per-day and per-timeframe but this doesn't seem necessary at all.

i'm going out this afternoon (lowkey dreading, i want to do more at home!!! more work!!!)
but i'm coming back and i

**need to**
- confirm the status of a collab sheet (for more algo play)
- make sure that sheet linking is correct
- prep a homebase for UGC flywheel
- build out a system for UGC self-reporting
- write a performance report template

**want to**
- read vercel documentation
- read typescript documentation
- figure out what i want to add to my random vercel experiment... i just made and deployed something last night but i genuinely went so fast i don't remember what i was doing
- investigate this new drone stuff going on
- investigate my hardware venture that i can't tell anyone about lol <3

**thinking of**
- the educational "out of bounds" book
- drawing from spotify API in terms of what song or what was last listened to
- social media algorithmic theory
- how does this play into ML

okay! i'm going to get ready to go out and be cute now xoxooo


NEED TO CONNECT GITHUB TO MY FILES IN CURSOR SO I HAVE PRE-DATED AND OUTLINED NAME FILES FOR EVERYDAY, THEN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY PUSH I MAKE IS UPDATED ON THE SITE
